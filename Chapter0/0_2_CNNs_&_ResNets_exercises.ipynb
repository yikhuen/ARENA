On the other hand, the **universal approximation theorem** tells us that we can approximate any continuous function using a sufficiently large neural network, if we use nonlinear activation functions. It's worth emphasizing that the theory of the UAT and what networks look like in practice are very different - in particular, many versions of the UAT are based on a shallow but extremely wide neural network, on the other hand most of the power of modern neural networks comes from their ability to compose between layers: feeding the output of one layer into the input of another, and create increasingly expressive functions.

        "The `torchvision` package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision, and `torchvision.transforms` provides access to a suite of functions for preprocessing data. We define a transform for the MNIST data (which is applied to each image in the dataset) by composing `ToTensor` (which converts a `PIL.Image` object into a PyTorch tensor) and `Normalize` (which takes arguments for the mean and standard deviation, and performs the linear transformation `x -> (x - mean) / std`). For the latter, we use `0.1307` and `0.3081` which are the empirical mean & std of the raw data (so after this transformation, the data will have mean 0 and variance 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we define our datasets using `torchvision.datasets`. The first argument tells us where to save our data to (so that when we run this in the future we won't have to re-save it), and `transform=MNIST_TRANSFORM` tells us that we should apply our previously defined `transform` to each element in our dataset. We also use `Subset` which allows us to return a slice of the dataset rather than the whole thing (because our model won't need much data to train!).\n",

        "Finally, since our dataset only allows for iteration over individual datapoints, we wrap it in `DataLoader` which enables iteration over **batches**.

The code above demonstrates iteration over the dataset & dataloader respectively, showing how the first element in the dataloader's first batch equals the first element in the dataset (note that this wouldn't be true for the training set, because we've shuffled it).\n",

The truth is a bit more complicated, and some studies dispute whether it actually saves time, so at this point it's more of a standard convention than a hard rule which will always lead to more efficient training.\n",

While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.\n",

This helper function used `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to load in data, and then (optionally) the `torch.utils.data.Subset` function to return a subset of this data. Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.\n",

Adam is generally the most popular and seen as the most effective in the majority of cases. We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).\n",

        "* You'll need a dataloader for the testset, just like we did for the trainset. It doesn't matter whether you shuffle the testset or not, because we're not updating our model parameters during validation (we usually set `shuffle=False` for testsets).\n",
        "    * You can set the same batch size as for your training set (we'll discuss more optimal choices for this later in the course).\n",
        "* During the validation step, you should be measuring **accuracy**, which is defined as **the fraction of correctly classified images**.\n",
        "    * Note that (unlike loss) accuracy should only be logged after you've gone through the whole validation set. This is because your model doesn't update between computing different accuracies, so it doesn't make sense to log all of them separately.\n",
        "    * Computing accuracy is meant to be a very short operation, so you shouldn't need a progress bar.\n",
        "    * You can wrap your forward pass in `with t.inference_mode():` to make sure that your model is in inference mode during validation (i.e. gradients don't propagate)."

        "A convolution is an operation which takes a kernel and slides it across the input, applying the kernel to each patch of the input. We can view it as a logical extension of the linear layer, except rather than having every output value being determined as a linear combination of every input value, we have a **prior of locality** - assuming that the input has some spatial structure, and each output value should only be determined by a small patch of the input. The kernel contains our learned weights, and we slide that kernel across our input, with each output value being computed by a sumproduct of the kernel values and the corresponding patch in the input. Note that we use all input channels when computing each output value, which means the sumproduct is over `kernel_length * in_channels` elements (or `kernel_width * kernel_height * in_channels` when, as is most often the case, we're using 2D kernels)."

This can be a bit fiddly to get right, especially if the names of your parameters are different to the names in the PyTorch implementation.

In these cases, you'll need to resort to different debugging methods, like running the models on the same input and checking they give the same output. You can also break this down into smaller steps by running individual models, and by checking the shape before checking values. However in this case we don't need to resort to that, because our implementation is equivalent to the reference model's implementation.\n",

So don't be disheartened if you find it hard to get exactly right (although we certainly recommend looking at the solutions and moving on if you're stuck on this particular exercise for more than ~45 minutes)."

But the parameter from the PyTorch model has shape `(128, 64, 3, 3)`, i.e. it's a convolutional weight with a 3x3 kernel, so must be from the left branch (it also matches the naming convention for the left-branch convolutional weight from the first blockgroup - row index 3 in the dataframe).

I see this as analogous to how [many CS courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) start by teaching you about languages like C and concepts like pointers and memory management before moving on to higher-level langauges like Python which abstract away these details. The hope is that when you get to the later sections of the course, you'll have the tools to understand them better."
